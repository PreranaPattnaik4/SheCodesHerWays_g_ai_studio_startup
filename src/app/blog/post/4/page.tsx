                    <p>Every movement begins with a spark — a spark of courage, vision, and hope. {brand.name} was born from such a spark. A dream to create a space where women don’t just learn skills, but rise with confidence. Where they don’t simply follow paths — they build their own.</p>
                    <p>Today, {brand.name} is officially stepping into a bold new chapter as a women-led digital empowerment platform, designed to uplift, guide, and inspire women to learn, lead, and rise together — across India and beyond.</p>
                    <p>This is more than a platform. It is a movement. It is a community. It is a shared rise.</p>
